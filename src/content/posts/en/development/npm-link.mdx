title: 'Using `npm link` to locally test npm package'

abstract: 'Sometimes we want to locally make some changes to an npm package that is used in another application, and test to see if it integrates correctly. Alternative to publishing the package every time you make a change in order to test it is to use `npm link` to have the other app use your local files as the npm package.'

## Scenario

We have some components that are published as a UI library in order to be used in different applications. We need to make some changes to the library components and we want to test those changes in other apps that use the library locally on our machine.

```
$ npm link //in folder of package we want to use in a different project
```

```
$ npm link <package_name> //in folder the different project
```
