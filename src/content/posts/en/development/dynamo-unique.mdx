## Various scenarios:

- Sort key must be unique
- Partition key must be unique
- GSI must be unique
- LSI must be unique
- Arbitrary property must be unique

Use `Condition Expression` and the `attribute_exists()`/`attribute_not_exists()` expressions to check for the uniqueness.

`Condition Expression` is evaluated ***AFTER*** a row is determined by the primary key and returned.
If the row returned in *null*, `attribute_exists()` will return **TRUE**, since there is no object in the table that has a NULL primary key.
