### Characteristics

- key size: 16-bit
- block size: 16-bit
- \# of rounds: 2

# AES algo:

- S-box
- Shift Rows
- Mix Columns
- Add round key
- key expansion

# S-box

Steps:

- associate each bit in the nibble to a polynomial in GF(2^4)

ex.1 0101 = x^2 + 1

ex.2 1011 = x^3 + x + 1

ex.3 1000 = x^3

- invert the polynomial using the polynomial ```x^4 + x + 1```

inverse = A(x) * B'(x) = 1 mod x^4 + x + 1

The inverse is called B'(x). 

- inverse is then run through the affine mapping

Affine mapping function multiplies the B' with a predefined 4x4 matrix and a predefined vector is then added. Addition and multiplication is done mod 2.
