## Necessary properties for encryption
- confusion
- difussion

## Cryptographic techinques:

- XOR (confusion) - adding the key
- S-box (confusion) - permutates the clear text
- Mix row (difussion) - makes it so that a single change in the clear text, creates a completely different cipher text
- Mix column (difussion) - Same sa above

## S-box

S-box is basically encoding the clear text.
It maps each input to an output.
Shift ciphers are basically just S-boxes.
They are weak encryption by themselves as they only provide confusion.
They can be thought of as lookup tables, where each input maps to a single cell in the table.
This is what _encoding_ is?

## Difussion

Diffusion is achieved in the encryption algorithm by using permutation of the data e.g. split the data in half and swapping the halves etc.

Mix rows and Mix columns steps in the AES algo do exactly this. They make sure that a change in a single bit value, generates a completely different output. 

## Adding the key

Key addition is the step that allows us to apply a unique key that will decrypt the encrypted text.
This step is usually implemented using the XOR techinque, since it provides a symmetrical process of encrypt/decrypt, using the same operation.

key length is a significant factor in the security of the algorithm. Generally the longer the key the better.

_key space_ is the set of all possible key values.

A small key space indicates that the encryption scheme is vulnerable to brute force attacks, since the attacker can just sequentially check all the possible key values until they arrive to the correct one.

This is why AES for example, uses 128/192/256-bit keys, which offer huge key spaces, since the number of possible combination of 128... bits is very large.

## TODO:

[ ] create a class for each of the techniques
